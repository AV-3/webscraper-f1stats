Web Scraper for F1 Statistics by Alan Velez

My first web scraper that will be utilized in the data collection of Formula One racing statistics to better understand
the contributing factors in winning Grands Prix, Constructors, and World Championships. I will be gathering and cleaning race statistics 
(lap times, qualifying results, pit stop times, race results, car failures, etc.) as well as drivers, teams, and specifications of the car (mostly engine specs).

I plan to use the wrangled data to determine the key factors in winning races and to predict the World Championship and World Constructors' Championship winner for the 2023 season.

Technologies: Python, Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Pandas, Jupyter
